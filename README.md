Checked all CSS color names from https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/named-colors-and-hex-equivalents/
- found black,blue,cyan,grey,green,purple,red,white,yellow no other matches, and all are named
- '[assembly:/_pro/environment/textures/constants/color_' + color + '.texture?/diffuse_a.tex](ascolormap).pc_tex'
- b for cyan, yellow
- c for yellow

Potential patterns:
[assembly:/_pro/environment/textures/generic/metal/gold_clean_a.texture?/diffuse_a.tex](ascolormap).pc_tex

You'll need to copy hashes.json to this folder from the latest release on my repo: https://github.com/dado3212/hitman-hashes-json/releases.
Then you'll need to run `python3 build.py`. After that, the other scripts will work, though they're all WIP and
are likely to change between versions.

https://github.com/dado3212/hitman-hash-reversal/commit/3d2a7b525c99750e6291960919bbbe584a0fdbbc had the version of main.py that I used to actually create the current shared list in new.txt.
